Provides classes and interfaces for authentication and privacy of SNMP(v3)
messages.
<p>
The <code>org.snmp4j.security</code> package contains three groups of
classes and interfaces:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The authentication protocols group contains interfaces and classes for
  authentication of SNMP(v3) messages.
</li>
<li>The privacy protocols group contains interfaces and classes for encryption
  and decryption of SNMP(v3) messages.
</li>
<li>The security model group combines authentication and privacy protocols
  to provide security services to message processing models.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Authentication as well as privacy protocols are security protocols and
  thus both are derived from the common interface <code>SecurityProtocol</code>.
  In order to be able to use a security protocol with SNMP4J, the protocol
  implementation class has to be registered with the
  <code>SecurityProtocols</code> singleton, which provides access to
  authentication and privacy protocols.
</p>
<h2>Authentication Protocols
</h2>
<p>
All SNMP4J authentication protocol implementations have to implement the
<code>AuthenticationProtocol</code> interface. SNMP4J provides implementation
for the following authentication protocols:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>MD5, which is implemented by <code>AuthMD5</code> and</li>
  <li>SHA, which is implemented by <code>AuthSHA</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Privacy Protocols
</h2>
<p>
  All SNMP4J privacy protocol implementations have to implement the
<code>PrivacyProtocol</code> interface. SNMP4J provides implementation
for the following privacy protocols:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>DES in CBC mode, which is implemented by <code>PrivDES</code> and</li>
  <li>AES with 128bit key, which is implemented by <code>PrivAES128</code>.
  </li>
  <li>AES with 192bit key, which is implemented by <code>PrivAES192</code>.
  </li>
  <li>AES with 256bit key, which is implemented by <code>PrivAES256</code>. In
    order to be able to use 256bit strong encryption, the strong encryption
    enhancement package has to be downloaded and installed.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Security Models
</h2>
<p>
All SNMP4J security models have to implement the <code>SecurityModel</code>
interface. Before a security model can be used with SNMP4J, it has to be
registered with the <code>SecurityModels</code> singleton which provides
access to security models. SNMP4J implements a single security model, the
<em>User Based Security Model (USM)</em>.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>USM</code> class uses a user name table (which contains
  user names) and a user table (which contains localized user information) to
  store user information. A time table is used to store time information
  about SNMP engines to protect SNMP communication against replay attacks
  if the corresponding security level has chosen.
</p>

  <code>org.snmp4j.security</code> package and their relationships
  (relationships to other packages are not shown):
