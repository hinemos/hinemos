package org.eclipse.draw2d.graph;

/**
 * Performs a graph layout on a <code>CompoundDirectedGraph</code>. The input
 * format is the same as for {@link DirectedGraphLayout}. All nodes, including
 * subgraphs and their children, should be added to the
 * {@link DirectedGraph#nodes} field.
 * <P>
 * The requirements for this algorithm are the same as those of
 * <code>DirectedGraphLayout</code>, with the following exceptions:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>There is an implied edge between a subgraph and each of its member nodes.
 * These edges form the containment graph <EM>T</EM>. Thus, the compound
 * directed graph <EM>CG</EM> is said to be connected iff Union(<EM>G</EM>,
 * <EM>T</EM>) is connected, where G represents the given nodes (including
 * subgraphs) and edges.
 * 
 * <LI>This algorithm will remove any compound cycles found in the input graph
 * <em>G</em> by inverting edges according to a heuristic until no more cycles
 * are found. A compound cycle is defined as: a cycle comprised of edges from
 * <EM>G</EM>, <EM>T</EM>, and <em>T<SUP>-1</SUP></em>, in the form
 * (c<SUP>*</SUP>e<SUP>+</SUP>p<SUP>*</SUP>e<SUP>+</SUP>)*, where
 * <em>T<SUP>-1</SUP></em> is the backwards graph of <EM>T</EM>, c element of T,
 * e element of G, and p element of T<SUP>-1</SUP>.
 * </UL>
