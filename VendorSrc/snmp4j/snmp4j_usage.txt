  -c  community         Sets the community for SNMPv1/v2c messages.
  -Ca agentAddress      Sets the agent address field of a V1TRAP PDU.
                        The default value is '0.0.0.0'.
  -Cg genericID         Sets the generic ID for SNMPv1 TRAPs (V1TRAP).
                        The default is 1 (coldStart).
  -Ce enterpriseOID     Sets the enterprise OID field of a V1TRAP PDU.
  -Cil lowerBoundIndex  Sets the lower bound index for TABLE operations.

  -Cn non-repeaters     Sets  the  non-repeaters field for GETBULK PDUs.
                        It specifies the number of supplied variables that
                        should not be iterated over. The default is 0.
  -Cr max-repetitions   Sets the max-repetitions field for GETBULK PDUs.
                        This specifies the maximum number of iterations
                        over the repeating variables. The default is 10.
  -Cs specificID        Sets the specific ID for V1TRAP PDU. The default is 0.
  -Ct trapOID           Sets the trapOID (1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.4.1.0) of an INFORM
                        or TRAP PDU. The default is 1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.1.
  -Cu upTime            Sets the sysUpTime field of an INFORM, TRAP, or
                        V1TRAP PDU.

  -e  engineID          Sets the authoritative engine ID of the command
                        responder used for SNMPv3 request messages. If not
                        supplied, the engine ID will be discovered.
  -E  contextEngineID   Sets the context engine ID used for the SNMPv3 scoped
                        PDU. The authoritative engine ID will be used for the
                        context engine ID, if the latter is not specified.
  -h                    Displays this message and then exits the application.
  -l  localEngineID     Sets the local engine ID of the command generator
                        and the notification receiver (thus this SNMP4J-Tool)
                        used for SNMPv3 request messages. This option can be
                        used to avoid engine ID clashes through duplicate IDs
                        leading to usmStatsNotInTimeWindows reports.
  -n  contextName       Sets the target context name for SNMPv3 messages. 
                        Default is the empty string.
  -m  maxSizeRespPDU    The maximum size of the response PDU in bytes.
  -Ocs <file>           Same as -Ow except that the retrieved values are also
                        written as a serialized ArrayList of VariableBinding
                        instances to the specified file. The snapshot format
                        can be read later by other applications, for example
                        MIB Explorer Pro 2.2 or later. See also -Ods.
  -Ods <file>           Reads the snapshot file and dumps its contents on
                        standard out. No SNMP operation will be done.
                        See also -Ocs.
  -Ol                   Activates listen operation mode. In this mode, the
                        application will listen for incoming TRAPs and INFORMs
                        on the supplied address. Received request will be
                        dumped to the console until the application is stopped.
  -Ot                   Activates table operation mode. In this mode, the
                        application receives tabular data from the column
                        OIDs specified as parameters. The retrieved rows will
                        be dumped to the console ordered by their index values.
  -Otd                  Activates dense table operation mode. In this mode, the
                        application receives tabular data from the column
                        OIDs specified as parameters. The retrieved rows will
                        be dumped to the console ordered by their index values.
                        In contrast to -Ot this option must not be used with
                        sparse tables. 
  -OtCSV                Same as -Ot except that for each SNMP row received
                        exactly one row of comma separated values will printed
                        to the console where the first column contains the row
                        index.
  -OttCSV               Same as -OtCSV except that each row's first column
                        will report the current time (millis after 1.1.1970)
                        when the request has been sent.
  -Ow                   Activates walk operation mode for GETNEXT and GETBULK
                        PDUs. If activated, the GETNEXT and GETBULK operations
                        will be repeated until all instances within the
                        OID subtree of the supplied OID have been retrieved
                        successfully or until an error occurred.
  -p  pduType           Specifies the PDU type to be used for the message.
                        Valid types are GET, GETNEXT, GETBULK (SNMPv2c/v3),
                        SET, INFORM, TRAP, and V1TRAP (SNMPv1).
  -P  privacyPassphrase Sets the privacy pass phrase for encrypted
                        SNMPv3 messages (same as -X).
  -r  retries           Sets the number of retries used for requests. A zero
                        value will send out a request exactly once.
                        Default is 1.
  -t  timeout           Sets the timeout in milliseconds between retries.
                        Default is 1000 milliseconds.
  -u  securityName      Sets the security name for authenticated v3 messages.
  -v  1|2c|3            Sets the SNMP protocol version to be used.
                        Default is 3.
  -V                    Displays version information and then exits.
  -x  privacyProtocol   Sets the privacy protocol to be used to encrypt
                        SNMPv3 messages. Valid values are DES, AES (AES128),
                        AES192, AES256, and 3DES(DESEDE).
  -X  privacyPassphrase Sets the privacy pass phrase for encrypted
                        SNMPv3 messages (same as -P).

The address of the target SNMP engine is parsed according to the
specified <transport> selector (default selector is udp):

  udp | tcp             hostname[/port]
                        ipv4Address[/port]
                        ipv6Address[/port]

The OIDs have to be specified in numerical form where strings may beenclosed in single quotes ('), for example:
  1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0  (which will return the sysName.0 instance with a GET)
  1.3.6.1.6.3.16.1.2.1.3.2.6.'public'  (which will return the 
    vacmGroupName.2.6.112.117.98.108.105.99 instance with a GET)
To request multiple instances, add additional OIDs with a space as
separator. For the last sub-identifier of a plain OID (without an assigned
value) a range can be specified, for example '1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1-10' will
has the same effect as enumerating all OIDs from '1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1' to
'1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.10'.
For SET and INFORM request, you can specify a value for each OID by
using the following form: OID={type}value where <type> is one of
the following single characters enclosed by '{' and '}':
  i                     Integer32
  u                     UnsingedInteger32, Gauge32
  s                     OCTET STRING
  x                     OCTET STRING specified as hex string where
                        bytes separated by colons (':').
  d                     OCTET STRING specified as decimal string
                        where bytes are separated by dots ('.').
  n                     Null
  o                     OBJECT IDENTIFIER
  t                     TimeTicks
  a                     IpAddress
  b                     OCTET STRING specified as binary string where
                        bytes are separated by spaces.

An example for a complete SNMPv2c SET request to set sysName:
 SNMP4J -c private -v 2c -p SET udp:localhost/161 "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0={s}SNMP4J"

To walk the whole MIB tree with GETBULK and using SNMPv3 MD5 authentication:
 SNMP4J -a MD5 -A MD5UserAuthPassword -u MD5User -p GETBULK -Ow 127.0.0.1/161

Listen for unauthenticated SNMPv3 INFORMs and TRAPs and all v1/v2c TRAPs:
 SNMP4J -u aSecurityName -Ol 0.0.0.0/162

Send an unauthenticated SNMPv3 notification (trap):
 SNMP4J -p TRAP -v 3 -u aSecurityName 127.0.0.1/162 "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0={t}0" \
  "1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.4.1.0={o}1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.1" \
  "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0={s}System XYZ, Version N.M"
Retrieve rows of the columnar objects ifDescr to ifInOctets and ifOutOctets:
 SNMP4J -c public -v 2c -Ot localhost 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2-10\
  1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16
