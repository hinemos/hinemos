Prepare the following jar manually because they are not showing up in maven repository yet.

* jpasecurity-core-0.4.0.jar
  Download from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpasecurity/files/jpasecurity/jpasecurity-0.4.0/jpasecurity-core-0.4.0.jar

* sblimCIMClient.jar
  Download from https://sourceforge.net/projects/sblim/files/sblim-cim-client/1.3.9.3/sblim-cim-client-1.3.9.3-bin.zip

* intel-wsman-1.0.1-mod.jar
  The most convenient way to get this jar is to install Hinemos Manager and copy fron the library directory.
  Note that the Hinemos's version is not exactly the same as Intel's original one. They fixed some bugs and rebuilt.
  You can also download and build from source yourself (at your own risk. I never tried myself).
