/**
 * A server push session is used to enable UI updates from a background thread for a certain period
 * of time.
 * <p>
 * Due to the request-response nature of HTTP, the client does not automatically notice UI updates
 * that happen outside of the UI thread (i.e. outside of a request). This is the case when e.g.
 * <code>Display.asyncExec()</code> is called from a background thread. Therefore, the framework
 * provides a mechanism called <em>server push</em> that maintains a standing connection to refresh
 * the client immediately in case of a UI update.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To activate the server push, create and start a ServerPushSession. Normally, the server push is
 * only needed for a certain period of time, e.g. while a background task is running and keeps
 * updating a progress bar. The push session should be stopped when it is no longer needed to allow
 * the server to free resources related to the server push.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Several independent server push sessions can be created and started in parallel within the same
 * UISession. As long as there is at least one server push session running, the server push will
 * remain active. A server push session can be re-used, i.e. started and stopped multiple times. If
 * not stopped explicitly, all server push sessions will be stopped when the UI session terminates.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example code:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * final ServerPushSession pushSession = new ServerPushSession();
 * Runnable bgRunnable = new Runnable() {
 *   public void run() {
 *     // do some background work ...
 *     // schedule the UI update
 *     display.asyncExec( new Runnable() {
 *       public void run() {
 *         if( !widget.isDisposed() ) {
 *           label.setText( "updated" );
 *         }
 *       }
 *     } );
 *     // close push session when finished
 *     pushSession.stop();
 *   } );
 * };
 * pushSession.start();
 * Thread bgThread = new Thread( bgRunnable );
 * bgThread.setDaemon( true );
 * bgThread.start();
 * </pre>
