Provides classes and interfaces for the SNMP message processing.
<p>
The <code>org.snmp4j.mp</code> classes provide services to process SNMP
messages. The services provided are defined in the
<code>MessageProcessingModel</code> interface and include the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare data elements from an incoming SNMP message as described in
  RFC3412 ยง7.2.
</li>
<li>Prepare a response message as defined in RFC3412 ยง7.1.
</li>
<li>Prepare an outgoing message as defined in RFC3412 ยง7.1.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This interface is implemented
by the message processing model classes for the SNMP versions 1, v2c, and v3:
<code>MPv1</code>, <code>MPv2c</code>, and <code>MPv3</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>MessageDispatcherImpl</code> chooses which message processing model
it uses to process an outgoing or incoming SNMP message based on the SNMP
version of the message. The SNMP version is either extracted from the message
header (incoming message) or from the <code>Target</code> instance associated
with the outgoing PDU (ougoing message).</p>
<p>
To be able to match requests and responses SNMP uses request IDs. Since request
IDs are created by the command generator, the request IDs are unique within
such a command generator only. SNMP4J therefore has to abstract from request IDs
and uses <code>PduHandle</code> instances instead.
</p>
<p>
  If a <code>PDU</code> is processed for sending by the SNMP4J
  <code>MessageDispatcherImpl</code> and
  the PDU's request ID is set to 0, then a SNMP4J application wide unique ID
  is generated and set as request ID of the supplied PDU. In any case, the
  PDU's request ID will be used as transaction ID of the outgoing message. The
  transaction ID identifies a messages <code>PduHandle</code>.
</p>
<p>
  If a <code>PDU</code> is received  by the SNMP4J
  <code>MessageDispatcherImpl</code> a unique transaction ID is generated so
  that command responders as well as the message processing model can match
  requests and responses.

  <code>org.snmp4j.mp</code> package and their relationships
