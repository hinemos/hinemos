/**
 * An application context represents a running instance of a RAP application. This context is shared
 * by all users who access this application. The current application context can be acquired by
 * {@link RWT#getApplicationContext()}. It can be used to store any data that is shared between all
 * UI sessions of an application, and to acquire application-scoped instances of framework services
 * such as the resource manager.
 * <p>
 * The application context is bound to the servlet context of the hosting web application. It is
 * destroyed when the web application ends (i.e. the servlet context is destroyed) or when the
 * application is explicitly stopped by calling {@link ApplicationRunner#stop()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The application context is <em>thread safe</em>, it can be accessed concurrently from different
 * threads.
